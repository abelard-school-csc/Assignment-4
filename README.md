# ICS4U - Assignment 4

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and processing employee, department, and project data using `pandas` in Python. The dataset consists of three main parts: employees, departments, and projects. Various analysis tasks, including salary calculations, budget analysis, and department summaries, are implemented in the Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb`.

## File Structure
- `main.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code and data analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: The file that contains the versions of dependencies used in the assignment.
- `LICENSE`: The MIT License for the project

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy
    ```
    OR
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Notebook
1. Open `main.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run the cells sequentially to see the results of each task.

## Tasks
The notebook includes the following analysis tasks:
1. Calculate the average salary per department.
2. Find the highest-paid employee in each department.
3. Calculate the total project budget for each department.
4. Find the total salary expense for departments managed by specific managers.
5. Calculate the average salary of employees working on high-budget projects.

Each of these tasks uses basic `pandas` operations such as merging, grouping, and aggregating data.
